    <h1>Emerald-Ash-Borer</h1>
    <p>The emerald ash borer is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to north-eastern Asia that feeds on ash species.</p>
    <p>Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. </p>
    <p>In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area.</p>
    <p>Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America.</p>
    <p>Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.</p>
